   <H2> HTML – Hyper Text Markup Language </H2>

Html is the language of the web. It is used to create websites.

We use HTML tags to define the look and feel of a website.

With an understanding of these tags and How to put them together, we can create beautiful websites easily!


Then why CSS and JavaScript
      HTML is used for defining the layout of a page – A barebone page structure.
      CSS is used to add styling to that barebone page created using HTML.
      JavaScript (JS) is used to program logic for the page layout. E.g. what happens when a user hovers on a text when to hide or show elements etc?


      A Beautiful analogy
HTML = Card body (only metal)

CSS = Car paint, design, etc.

JavaScript = Car engine + Interior logic

 

We will start learning how to build beautiful layouts in this course.

 

Installing VS Code
We can use any text editor of our choice. Here, I am using VS Code because it is lightweight, open-source & from Microsoft.

      Go to google, search for VS Code, download and install it.
NOTE: You can write HTML even in Notepad. Text editors like VS Code just makes things easier.

Chapter – 1 (Creating our first website)
 We start to build a website by creating a file named index.html, index.html is a special filename that is presented when the website root address is typed.

 

A Basic HTML Page

<!Doctype html> - Specifies this is an html5 document

<html> - root of an HTML page

<head> - Contains page metadata

<title> Harry’s Website </title>  - Contains title

</head>                                                   

<body> - Main body of the page (rendered by browser)

<h1> This is a heading </h1>  - heading tag

>p> My paragraph </p> - paragraph tag

</body> - closing body tag

</html> - closing html tag

 A tag is like a container for either content or other HTML tags.

    
</body>
</html>


Important Notes:

      Head & body tags are children of HTML tag.
      HTML is the parent of Head and Body tags.
      Most of the HTML elements have opening & closing tag with content in between opening and closing tags.
      Some HTML tags have no content. These are called Empty elements. For example, <br> tag
      We can either use .htm or .html extension to save our html code.
      You can use the “Inspect Element” or “View Page Source” option from chrome to look into a website’s HTML code.


      Comments in HTML

      Comments in HTML are used to mark text which should not be parsed. They can help during documentation of the source code.
      
      <!-- HTML Comment -->
      
       
      
      Case Sensitivity
      
      HTML is a case insensitive language. <H1> and <h1> tags are the same.

        We can add elements inside the body tag to define the page layout.

 

        HTML Element
        
        Everything from starting to the ending tag
        
        <body>    - Opening tag
        
        -Content-
        
        </body>   - Closing tag
        
         
        
        HTML Attributes
        
        Used to add more information corresponding to an HTML tag.
        
        Example: <a href=”https://codewithharry.com/”> Harry’s Site </a>
        
        <a = anchor tag
        
        href is the attribute of above element
        
        We can either use single or double quotes in attributes.

        The Heading Tag

        Heading tag is used to mark heading in HTML. From h1 to h6, we have tags for the most important to the least important heading.
        
        <h1> Most important heading </h1>
        
        <h2> Another heading H2 </h2>
        
        <h3> Another heading H3 </h3>
        
        <h4> Another heading H4 </h4>
        
        <h5> Another heading H5 </h5>
        
        <h6> Least important heading </h6>
        
        Note: We should not use HTML headings to make text thick or bold.
        
         
        
        The Paragraph Tag
        
        Paragraph tags are used to add paragraphs to an HTML page.
        
        <p> This is a paragraph </p>
